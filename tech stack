Perfect question. I’ll give you **one clean, final list** — **no confusion, no missing items** — exactly what a **senior interviewer** would expect you to know about your own project.

This is the **AWS MEGA PROJECT – FINAL STACK**.

## 🔥 10. SRE Practices (Not Just Services)

These are **VERY IMPORTANT** — interviewers care a lot.

* SLO / RTO / RPO definition
* Failure Playbooks
* Chaos / Failure Testing

  * Kill EC2
  * Break DB connection
  * Stop Redis
* Incident Simulation
* RCA (Root Cause Analysis) Document

👉 **Purpose:** Prove reliability engineering mindset

---

## 🧰 11. Tools & Supporting Utilities

* AWS Console (manual build first)
* AWS CLI
* Loom (architecture & failure demos)
* Git (documentation & versioning)

---

# 🧠 HOW AN INTERVIEWER WILL SEE THIS

They won’t think:

> “He used many AWS services”

They will think:

> **“He designed, operated, secured, monitored, broke, and recovered a real system.”**

That is **DevOps + SRE combined**.

---

## 🎯 IMPORTANT FINAL NOTE

* ✔ Nothing unnecessary
* ✔ Nothing missing
* ✔ No over-engineering
* ✔ Clear growth path (manual → Terraform later)

This stack is **strong enough to stop rejections** if you can explain it calmly.

---

If you want, next I can:

* Map **each service → interview questions**, or
* Convert this into a **resume-ready project section**

Just tell me which one.
