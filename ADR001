phase 0
why aws
why one region
why multi az
why this project
whats benefit of this project
what the use of this project
why terraform 
why s3 and dynamodb
why terraform state lock file using s3 and dynamodb
how you access aws
which website and app used
what is the purpose behind it


phase 1 
why create vpc
why public subnet private subnet
why internet gateway
why route tables
cidr block ranges why those 10.0.0.0/16  10.0.1.0/24 10.0.2.0/24
why public and private route tables
why we enable dns support and dns hostnames
why igw use vpc id
why in terrfaorm tags are used and $for input in curly braces
why this map_public_ip_on_launch = true → makes it public
availability zone of subnets
why route table association with publicRt and private rt
why nat gateway need elastic ip
what is elastic ip

“Why didn’t you add NAT in Phase-1?
why bastion host why multi az
why public and private sg
why private rt
why nat is depends on aws igw
why elastic ip used to connect nat ip
why need of private sg and also public sg
why private sg on inbound rules in first (for alb and eks sg)
why we created alb first
why nlb>>alb intentional
why alb and nlb
why cloudfront
why waf

why target groups needed
why we create new sg for alb
how to create cdn what is use and how we are goig to added it
waf
web acl
how what why wherer all thing realted to waf
checked link cdn.net like this 504 error 
why sg is not there in nlb
why waf

phase 3
why we use template
whyy private sg used
why no public ip
why amazon linux 2
why user data for nginx/apache  simple htmlpage
why only alb talk to them ec2

phsae 4 (database layer)
why all
why rds,dynamodb,redis,s3
App (EC2)
 ├─ RDS → transactions
 ├─ Redis → cache
 ├─ DynamoDB → sessions/state
 └─ S3 → files/logs
why create s3 first
usage of all 


phase 5 async and serverleass
why lambda
why sqs
why s3 events and policies
why async and what 
use cases in our projects and actual use cases


phase 6 
CloudWatch (baseline)
├── Metrics
├── Logs
├── Alarms
├── Dashboards
│
Prometheus + Grafana (infra metrics)
│
ELK (log analytics – design level)
why cloudwatch
in cloudwatch metrics find is hard there lot of instances in which some are terminated and running how
why we use node exporter why not k8s
why we dongt fully deploy elk
EC2 / Lambda logs
 ↓
Logstash / Fluent Bit
 ↓
Elasticsearch / OpenSearch
 ↓
Kibana
why AWS-native alternative

Amazon OpenSearch Service

CloudWatch Logs subscription

why we are not using elk
CloudWatch Metrics   → system health
CloudWatch Logs      → debugging
CloudWatch Alarms    → alerting
CloudWatch Dashboards→ visibility
SNS                  → notifications


phase 7 cicd github+jenkins  or github+awscodepipeline+awscodebuild+asg rolling updates


why we give iam roles to the services forexample rds,codebuild,lambda,s3
